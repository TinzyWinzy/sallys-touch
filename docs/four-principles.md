# Four Principles for LLM-Aided Development

## 1. Think Before Coding

Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.

- **State assumptions explicitly** — If uncertain, ask rather than guess
- **Present multiple interpretations** — Don't pick silently when ambiguity exists
- **Push back when warranted** — If a simpler approach exists, say so
- **Stop when confused** — Name what's unclear and ask for clarification

**Addresses:** Wrong assumptions, hidden confusion, missing tradeoffs

## 2. Simplicity First

Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.

- No features beyond what was asked
- No abstractions for single-use code
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested
- No error handling for impossible scenarios
- If 200 lines could be 50, rewrite it

**Test:** Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated? If yes, simplify.

**Addresses:** Overcomplication, bloated abstractions

## 3. Surgical Changes

Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked

**Test:** Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

**Addresses:** Orthogonal edits, touching code you shouldn't

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

Define success criteria. Loop until verified.

| Instead of... | Transform to... |
|---|---|
| "Add validation" | "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass" |
| "Fix the bug" | "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass" |
| "Refactor X" | "Ensure tests pass before and after" |

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]

**Addresses:** Leverage through tests-first, verifiable success criteria
